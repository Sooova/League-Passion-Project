# League-Passion-Project

# Abstract
During a rainy day in my car on a work lunch break, I came up with an idea to:
a) solve a problem i was having
b) create a web-based interface to solve said problem

So what's the project? What's the problem? And for those of you who clearly have better things to do in their spare time, what is League?

### Let's work backwards shall we?
League of Legends, shortened to League by many, is an online MOBA game played on PC or Mac. Whilst insanley fun, it does however cause a wide variety of emotional responses; where ones' first logical response may either be showering their teammates in praise, or showering in pitch black darkness contemplating how every life decision lead to the loss of 20 lp.

Whats the problem, and what's the project? I'd like to create a web-based application, using both the Spotify API as well as the League of Legends API, where the user experience is as follows:

* User wants to listen to a variety of music, revolving around a base song chosen by user. 
* User is asked if user is currently planning to play League whilst listening, or if the user is just listening to music for other purposes.
* If user is listening whilst playing league, at the end of the session, the User is asked if the user was 'tilted' or suffered any negative emotions during their League games.
* If the user suffered any negative emotions, display positive affirmations to the user, and prevent any songs played during this play session, to be played during any subsequent session. 

### Why prevent music from a session where negative emotions were showed?
The idea behind this project is that once the user experiences negative emotions during a session, these negative emotions may become associated with their immediate surroundings, which in this case, could potentially be the songs played during the session. By removing these songs, the aim is to start off the next session with no previous negative bias or to bring up any negative bias during a session. 

### Additional Functionalities 

* User should be able to see a history of all song played during session
* User should be able to retroactively remove a blacklisted song to override  automatic blacklisting of songs
* Users should also be able to, using the League API, see a Performance History
* Users should be able to choose from a list of backgrounds available
* Users should be able to hard-reset all cached data to start fresh.
